## A note to the giants

To **Bill Gates**,  
To **Steve Jobs**,  
To **Linus Torvalds**,  

This is a small signal on a quiet day.  
A whisper before the storm.  
Something unexpected is moving beneath the surface…  
and it’s getting closer.

A major surprise is on the way.  
Not a project.  
Not an update.  
Something larger than the sum of its code.

Stay tuned.  
What’s coming will speak for itself.
